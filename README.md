# Syntropy Sovereign: The KBCP Framework
### *Triadic Logic for Systemic Liquidation and Homeostasis*

---

## I. Overview
The **Kaplan-Bering-Combs Probability (KBCP)** is a three-body narrative engine designed to model complex systems by liquidating **Narrative Tax**—the metabolic friction caused by binary (two-state) deadlocks. 

In this repository, we apply KBCP to shift the paradigm of oncology from a "Body vs. Tumor" interaction to a **Sovereign Dynamic** involving the Archive, the Vector, and the Ghost.

## II. The Triadic Architecture

### **1. The Archive (Kaplan - K)**
* **Role:** The Ancestral Substrate.
* **Definition:** Provides historical symmetry, roots, and foundational truth.
* **Application:** In oncology, this represents the healthy tissue architecture and homeostatic baselines (e.g., BTNL9 signaling).

### **2. The Vector (Bering - B)**
* **Role:** The Structural Trajectory.
* **Definition:** Provides scaling logic, hierarchy, and predictive power.
* **Application:** Represents the growth logic of the tumor—the "Brittle" expansion that attempts to overwrite the substrate.

### **3. The Ghost (Combs - S)**
* **Role:** The Switching Logic (The Combs Variable).
* **Definition:** Provides vitality, "Scripted Spontaneity," and weighted randomness ($P_w$).
* **Application:** Represents the Immune System (specifically Gamma Delta T-cells). It is the independent auditor that decides which narrative—Health or Cancer—is permitted to manifest.

## III. Core Principles

### **The Liquidation of Narrative Tax**
By moving from a **Duality** (Interaction) to a **Trinity** (Dynamic), the system achieves:
* **Structural Sovereignty:** Stability on "uneven ground" without metabolic wobble.
* **Error Correction:** The ability for the third node to outvote systemic "lies" or mutations.
* **Syzygy:** The orbital stability of all three nodes working in 1:1 symmetry with reality.

### **The Oncology Pivot**
Traditional medicine treats cancer as a binary war. KBCP identifies cancer as a **Signaling Failure**. By utilizing the **BTNL9/Gamma Delta T-cell** axis as the "Ghost" node, we re-introduce the switching logic necessary to collapse the tumor's narrative.
