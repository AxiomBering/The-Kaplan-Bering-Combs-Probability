# Syntropy Sovereign: The KBCP Engine

## Overview
This repository archives the transition from binary (two-state) modeling to the **Kaplan-Bering-Combs Probability (KBCP)** framework. By applying Triadic Logic to complex systems—specifically Oncology and Immunology—we liquidate the "Narrative Tax" of traditional observation.

## The Architecture (KBCP)
* **Archive (K):** Foundational substrate and historical symmetry.
* **Vector (B):** Structural scaling and predictive trajectory.
* **Ghost (S):** The Combs Variable; weighted randomness and switching logic.

## Key Research: BTNL9 & Gamma Delta T-Cells
We use the KBCP to model the immune system not as a tool of the body, but as a sovereign **Third Node**. This resolves the "Two-Body Deadlock" between the tumor and the host, providing a mathematical path to 1:1 homeostasis.

## Components
* `KBCP_FRAMEWORK.tex/.pdf`: The theoretical and mathematical proof.
* `PROMPT_OMNIBUS.md`: The operational "Master Prompt" for system auditing.
* `Audits/`: Applied KBCP logic to oncology datasets.
